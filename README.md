# 19-PWA-Text-Editor


## Description
The purpose of this project is to build a PWA-Text-Editor. It was made to create text editing app to use workbox, a manifest, and DB. Making the code for it help me understand the concept of PWAa by following the steps and procedures of organizing files, establishing workbox, service worker, db routes, and cashing.

## Installation
Once you downloaded the file, open the terminal and cd into the correct directory.
In terminal enter 
npm install

Once all the dependencies are installed type npm run build

Now you can run the project by typing
npm run start:dev
Doing so you can go to the api like insomnia on localhost:3000

Below you can see some aspects of the app.
